### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 2 is a favorite as I had always loved playing games. Being
    able to create a game that actually runs how its supposed to gave a
    sense of accomplishment. While also learning how to write functions
    and being able to take command arguments and implement them into the
    code.

* Lab 1 

    The whole of lab 1 was one of my favorites as it marked the beginning 
    of my coding journey. I was able to learn the use of commands and how
    they work together in tandem with VS Code editor. Being able to get
    started this way will be something that I will remember for years to
    come

* Lab 9

    Lab 9, part 1 was another one of my favorites as I liked how it posed
    a little challenge for me. Being able to get through the challenge I
    felt proud. Being able to learn how to use for loops, while also
    watching for syntax errors definitely taught me a lot in this lab.
